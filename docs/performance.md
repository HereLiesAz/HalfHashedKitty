# Performance

This document outlines performance-related guidelines and requirements for the application.

## General Performance Guidelines

-   **Optimize Resource Usage:** Be mindful of CPU, memory, and network usage. Avoid unnecessary computations, memory allocations, and network requests.
-   **Write Efficient Code:** Write code that is efficient and performs well. Avoid algorithms with high time or space complexity where possible.
-   **Profile Your Code:** Use profiling tools to identify and address performance bottlenecks.
-   **Consider User Experience:** Performance is not just about raw numbers. It's also about the user's perception of performance. Ensure the UI is responsive and does not block the main thread.
