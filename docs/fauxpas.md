# Faux Pas

This document lists common mistakes and how to avoid them to ensure a smooth and effective development process.

## General Development Faux Pas

-   **Ignoring Documentation:** Always read the `README.md`, `AGENTS.md`, and other relevant documentation before starting work. This will save time and prevent misunderstandings.
-   **Not Running Tests:** Before submitting any changes, you must run all relevant tests to ensure that your changes are correct and do not introduce any regressions.
-   **Unclear Commit Messages:** Write clear, concise, and descriptive commit messages. The subject line should be a short summary of the change, and the body should provide more context if necessary.
-   **Large, Monolithic Commits:** Break down large changes into smaller, logical commits. This makes the review process easier and helps to isolate any potential issues.
-   **Ignoring the Linter:** Always run the linter and address any issues it raises. This helps to maintain a consistent code style across the project.
